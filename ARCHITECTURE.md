# Architecture

This guide explains how agentic-insomnia works inside, for people who want to read or change the
code. For installing and configuring it, see the [README](README.md).

## The short version

agentic-insomnia keeps a computer awake while an AI coding harness (Claude Code or OpenCode) is
working, and lets it sleep again once the harness goes idle.

It runs two kinds of processes:

- **Clients** are short-lived. The harness runs `caffeine.js caffeinate` or
  `caffeine.js uncaffeinate` on its events. A client records the session in a JSON file, makes
  sure a server is running, and exits. Clients never load Electron, so hooks stay fast.
- **The server** is long-lived. Every 5 seconds it reads the session file. While at least one
  session is active, it holds a sleep lock. When no session is active, it releases the lock.

The session file is the only channel between them. Clients and the server never talk directly.

## Repository layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `caffeine.js` | Entry point. Routes `caffeinate`, `uncaffeinate`, `server`, `status`, `version`. |
| `src/commands.js` | Client commands: read the hook's JSON from stdin, update the session file, start the server. |
| `src/session.js` | The session file: add, remove, expire, read. Every access is locked. |
| `src/pid.js` | The server PID file, heartbeat, startup marker, and "is a real server running?" checks. |
| `src/server.js` | Starts the server, as an Electron app or as a plain Node process. |
| `src/poller.js` | **Decision**: when to hold or release the sleep lock. |
| `src/backend.js` | **Mechanism** seam: picks a backend and dispatches to it. |
| `src/native.js` | Native backend: `caffeinate` on macOS, `systemd-inhibit` on Linux, a PowerShell power request on Windows. |
| `src/system-tray.js` | **UI**: the tray icon and its Exit menu. Also owns server shutdown. |
| `src/electron.js` | Loads Electron only when it is needed. |
| `src/config.js` | Reads `~/.claude/plugins/agentic-insomnia/config.json` once and caches it. |
| `hooks/hooks.json` | Claude Code hook registration used by the plugin install. |
| `opencode/agentic-insomnia.mjs` | OpenCode plugin. One file, because OpenCode loads one plugin file. |
| `test/` | `node --test` suites. |

## Integrations

Both harnesses end up calling the same two client commands, so all session and timeout logic
lives in one place.

- **Claude Code** runs hooks from `hooks/hooks.json`. `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, and
  `PostToolUse` call `caffeinate`. `Notification`, `Stop`, and `SessionEnd` call
  `uncaffeinate`. Each hook pipes `{"session_id": "..."}` to the command's stdin.
- **OpenCode** has no external hooks, so `opencode/agentic-insomnia.mjs` listens to in-process
  events. `session.created`, `command.executed`, and `message.updated` map to `caffeinate`.
  `session.idle` and `session.deleted` map to `uncaffeinate`. The plugin then runs the same
  CLI.

The `uncaffeinate` calls are a shortcut, not the only release path. If a harness crashes and
never sends one, the session still expires after the idle timeout.

## The session file

Location: `~/.claude/plugins/agentic-insomnia/sessions.json`

```json
{
  "sessions": {
    "abc123": {
      "created_at": "2025-01-08T10:30:00.000Z",
      "last_activity": "2025-01-08T10:45:00.000Z"
    }
  },
  "last_updated": "2025-01-08T10:45:00.000Z"
}
```

- `caffeinate` adds a session, or updates `last_activity` if it exists.
  `uncaffeinate` removes it.
- A session expires after `session_timeout_minutes` (default 15) without activity. Expired
  sessions are removed on every add, remove, and poll.
- Many hooks can fire at once, so every read and write holds a
  [proper-lockfile](https://github.com/moxystudio/node-proper-lockfile) lock. The lock is held
  only for the read-modify-write itself.

## Server lifecycle

### Starting exactly one server

Hooks fire in bursts, and several clients may find "no server" at the same moment. Startup is
guarded so only one of them starts a server:

1. Inside a lock on `server.pid`, the client checks for a running server and for a recent
   `server.starting` marker (30 second grace period).
2. If neither exists, it writes the marker and releases the lock. Other clients now see the
   marker and back off.
3. It spawns the server detached: `npm run server` (Electron) or `npm run native-server`
   (plain Node), based on the resolved backend.
4. The server takes the same lock and writes its own PID.

"Is a server running?" means more than "the PID is alive". `pid.js` also reads that process's
command line (`ps -ww`, or PowerShell `Get-CimInstance` on Windows) and checks that it is a
caffeine server. A PID reused by an unrelated process is not trusted.

On Windows, starting PowerShell takes about a second, and hooks run this check on every tool
call. So on Windows a live PID with a fresh `server.heartbeat` counts as running, and the command
line is not read. The server writes the heartbeat together with its PID and refreshes it on every
poll. A heartbeat that names another PID, or is older than 30 seconds, is ignored, and the check
falls back to the command line.

### Running

The server calls `startPolling(state, 5000, onStateChange, onOwnershipLost)`. On each tick the
poller:

1. checks that `server.pid` still names this server; if another server owns it, the poller
   stops and calls `onOwnershipLost(state)` (see "Stopping"),
2. refreshes `server.heartbeat`,
3. removes expired sessions,
4. counts active sessions,
5. calls `enableCaffeine(state)` or `disableCaffeine(state)` if the answer changed,
6. calls `onStateChange(state)` if a UI passed one in.

`state` is a plain object that the server owns. Backends keep their handles on it, for example
`powerSaveBlockerId` or `caffeinateProcess`.

### Stopping

`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, or the tray's Exit item call `shutdownServer(state)`. It stops polling,
releases the sleep lock, destroys the tray, and removes the PID file and heartbeat.

A server also stops when another server has replaced it. If a startup race ever leaves two
servers running, only one owns `server.pid`. The other sees this on its next poll, runs
`shutdownServer(state)`, and exits, so it cannot keep a tray icon or sleep lock forever. A
missing or unreadable PID file does not count as replaced.

## Three concerns, kept apart

| Concern | Question | Module |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Decision | *When* should the machine stay awake? | `poller.js` |
| Mechanism | *How* is sleep prevented? | `backend.js`, `native.js` |
| UI | *What* does the user see? | `system-tray.js` |

The poller and the tray used to import each other. Two small injections break that loop:

- The poller takes an optional `onStateChange` callback instead of importing the tray. The
  tray passes `updateTrayIcon`. The native server passes nothing, so it has no UI.
- `startPolling` stores `state.stopPolling`, so shutdown can stop the poller without importing
  it.

## Sleep backends

| Backend | Config value | How it prevents sleep | Server process | Tray |
|---------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------|------|
| Electron | `"electron"` (default) | `powerSaveBlocker.start('prevent-app-suspension')` | Electron | Yes |
| Native, macOS | `"native"` | child process `caffeinate -i` | Node | No |
| Native, Linux | `"native"` | child process `systemd-inhibit ... cat` | Node | No |
| Native, Windows | `"native"` | child process `powershell.exe` holding a power request | Node | No |

### Choosing a backend

`getSleepBackend()` in `backend.js` makes the choice once per process and caches it:

- Config is not `"native"`: use `electron`.
- Config is `"native"` and `native.isAvailable()` is true: use `native`.
- Otherwise: log a warning and use `electron`.

`isAvailable()` looks for `caffeinate` on `PATH` on macOS. On Linux it needs both
`/run/systemd/system` (the machine booted with systemd) and `systemd-inhibit` on `PATH`. On
Windows it checks that `%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` exists. It
does not start PowerShell, because clients call it on every hook. Every other platform returns
false.

The client uses the same function to pick which server script to spawn. The server uses it to
dispatch. Caching keeps those two answers the same for the life of the process.

### When a native tool fails

A native tool can fail to start (for example, the binary is missing) or exit right away (for
example, polkit denies the lock). If either happens within 2 seconds of starting, `native.js`
records the reason on `state.nativeFailure`, logs it once, and ignores later enable calls.
Without this guard, the poller would respawn a failing process every 5 seconds.

A tool that exits later, after running normally, is treated as a normal stop. The next poll
starts it again.

The 2 second rule does not fit Windows, because PowerShell can take longer than that to start and
fail. There, the script prints `ready` once it holds the power request. An exit before `ready` is a
failure no matter how long it took. A script that prints nothing for 15 seconds is killed and
recorded as a failure. An exit after `ready` is a normal stop.

The server does not switch to Electron after a failure at runtime. That would mean restarting
as a different kind of process.

### The Linux backend in detail

The server runs:

```
systemd-inhibit --what=sleep:idle --who=agentic-insomnia --why="coding agent session active" --mode=block cat
```

with stdin as a pipe from the server and stderr captured for error messages.

- `systemd-inhibit` asks logind for a **block** lock on `sleep` (suspend and hibernate) and
  `idle` (logind's idle action). It holds the lock while its child command runs.
- The child is `cat`, which reads the pipe from the server and never exits on its own.
- **Normal release**: the server kills `systemd-inhibit`. systemd starts its child with a
  "kill me when my parent dies" signal, so `cat` ends too, and logind drops the lock.
- **Crash release**: if the server dies, even by `SIGKILL`, the OS closes the pipe. `cat` sees
  end of input and exits, `systemd-inhibit` exits, and the lock goes away. `sleep infinity`
  would not do this, which is why the child is `cat`.

Known limits:

- Needs systemd and logind. Other init systems fall back to Electron.
- Works from a login session. Processes outside a session may be denied the lock, depending on
  the distro's polkit rules. Arch with systemd 261 allowed it from `systemd-run --user`.
- Does not stop screen blanking or locking, the same as Electron's `prevent-app-suspension`.
- Does not block lid-close suspend (`handle-lid-switch`).
- Electron on Linux talks to the desktop's session manager over D-Bus. This backend talks to
  logind, which refuses suspend requests while the lock is held. Tested on Omarchy (Arch),
  systemd 261, Hyprland. A desktop idle screen lock that uses Wayland idle inhibitors still
  locks the screen.

### The Windows backend in detail

Windows has no sleep command. The server runs the Windows PowerShell 5.1 that ships with Windows
10 and 11, by its absolute path (`%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`),
with `-NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command <script>`, all stdio piped, and the window
hidden.

The script:

1. declares `PowerCreateRequest` and `PowerSetRequest` from `kernel32.dll` through .NET
   reflection,
2. creates a power request with the reason `agentic-insomnia: coding agent session active` and sets
   `PowerRequestSystemRequired`,
3. prints `ready`,
4. reads stdin until it closes.

- **Normal release**: the server kills PowerShell. Windows closes the request handle when the
  process exits, which ends the request.
- **Crash release**: Windows does not end a child process when its parent dies. If the server
  dies, the OS closes the stdin pipe, `ReadToEnd()` returns, and PowerShell exits. This is the
  same idea as `cat` in the Linux backend.

Why it is shaped this way:

- Electron's `powerSaveBlocker` uses the same `PowerCreateRequest` and `PowerSetRequest` API on
  Windows, so both backends behave alike.
- Reflection instead of `Add-Type`: `Add-Type` starts the C# compiler, which is slower and more
  likely to alarm antivirus software.
- No double quotes in the script, so it passes through Windows command-line quoting unchanged.
- `-Command` instead of a `.ps1` file: `-Command` is not subject to the execution policy, so no
  `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` is needed.

Known limits:

- On Modern Standby laptops on battery, Windows ends the request 5 minutes after the sleep
  timeout. Electron has the same limit.
- Closing the lid, pressing the power button, or choosing Sleep ends all power requests.
- Does not keep the display on, the same as Electron's `prevent-app-suspension`.
- Constrained Language Mode (AppLocker, WDAC) blocks the reflection calls. The script fails
  before `ready`, and the failure is logged once.
- `powercfg /requests` shows the reason while the request is held. It needs an administrator
  terminal.

## Configuration

`config.js` merges `~/.claude/plugins/agentic-insomnia/config.json` over its defaults and caches
the result for the life of the process. A running server keeps its config until it restarts.
See the README for the settings.

## Testing

Run `npm test` (Node's built-in `node --test`) and `npm run lint`. `npm run lint` fails on
violations; `npm run lint:fix` fixes what it can.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is one job on Ubuntu, on the Node version in `.node-version`.
It checks that `package.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` have the same version, then runs
lint, the tests, and `node caffeine.js version`. Tests must pass on every OS, so they never
depend on the machine they run on:

- `native.js` takes its dependencies through `setDependencies({ spawn, platform,
  commandExists, isSystemdBooted, fileExists, now })`. Tests pass a fake child process, a fixed
  platform, and a fake clock. The Windows ready timeout uses `setTimeout`, which tests replace
  with `t.mock.timers`.
- `pid.js` takes `setDependencies({ platform, now })`, so the Windows heartbeat check runs on
  any OS.
- Modules that read config or Electron are replaced in `require.cache` before the module
  under test loads. See `test/backend-native.test.js`.
- Each test reloads the module under test, so cached state (like the resolved backend) starts
  fresh.

Some behavior can only be proven on a real machine, such as whether a desktop honors a logind
lock. Check those by hand and describe what you checked in the pull request.

## Adding a sleep backend

1. Write `enableCaffeine(state)` and `disableCaffeine(state)`. Both must be safe to call twice.
   Keep any handles on `state`.
2. Write an availability check, and record startup failures on `state` so the poller does not
   retry forever.
3. Wire it into `getSleepBackend()` and the dispatch in `backend.js`.
4. If it does not need Electron, reuse the plain Node server path in `server.js`.
5. Add tests with injected dependencies and a fixed platform.
6. Update the README config table, this file, and `AGENTS.md`. Use a `feat:` commit message.
   release-please then bumps the version and writes the changelog entry. Do not edit either by
   hand.
