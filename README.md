**Transform your 9-to-5 into 9:30-to-4:30.** Arrive 30min later, leave 30min earlier, while getting the same work done because **Claude Code stays powered in your backpack while commuting.**

Work smarter, not longer.

## 🌍 The Modern Developer's Freedom

Tired of your laptop going to sleep during that perfect coding session because you left your desk 10 minutes? Frustrated when Claude Code disconnects mid-commute because your computer decided it was "idle"?

**cc-caffeine is your personal rebellion against screen timeout.** It keeps your machine awake so you can:

- 🚇 Code on the RER between Paris and suburbs
- ☕ Sip a latte at Starbucks during 3-hour debugging sessions
- 🚴‍♂️ Pedal to the coworking space while maintaining your active connection
- 📱 Respond to your girlfriend calls during work hours, without Claude Code interruptions

## 🌟 The Nomad Developer Manifesto

> "I'll never choose between coding and traveling again. With cc-caffeine, I can do both. My laptop will never sleep while I traverse cities in 5G, my Claude Code will stay connected in my backpack, and my productivity will soar. The future of mobile development is here, and it smells like coffee."

## ✨ Why It's Pure Magic

**Automatic Intelligence**: cc-caffeine knows when Claude Code is working and prevents your computer from sleeping. Period.

**System Tray Chic**: A tiny ☕️ icon in your status bar to know instantly if you're protected.

**Perfect Sessions**: Multiple simultaneous Claude Code sessions? No problem.

**Zero Configuration**: Install, run, forget. It's like coffee, but for your computer.

## 🎭 Claude Code Integration

Hooks will be configured automatically if you import the project as a Claude Code plugin.

Otherwise, configure your Claude Code hooks for a seamless experience:

```json
{
  "UserPromptSubmit": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "npx cc-caffeine caffeinate"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "npx cc-caffeine caffeinate"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "PostToolUse": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "npx cc-caffeine caffeinate"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Notification": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "npx cc-caffeine uncaffeinate"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Stop": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "npx cc-caffeine uncaffeinate"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "SessionEnd": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "npx cc-caffeine uncaffeinate"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 💡 The Secret Sauce

cc-caffeine uses an intelligent client-server approach:

1. **Lightweight Client** (`caffeinate`/`uncaffeinate`) - No Electron loading, just fast JSON writes
2. **System Server** (`server`) - Headless Electron app that monitors sessions and manages power
3. **Communication** - JSON file with atomic locking for perfect coordination

## 📋 Requirements

- Node.js >= 14.0.0 (your coffee of choice)
- Electron (included automatically, like sugar in your espresso)
- A burning desire to code everywhere, all the time

## 🚀 Run without Claude Code

```bash
# Start server + system tray
# (optional - will be started automatically)
npx cc-caffeine server

claude -p 'Write 10 pages of "lorem ipsum"'

npx cc-caffeine status
```

Manual switch:

```bash
# Activate caffeine for your coding session
echo '{"session_id": "session-abcd"}' | npx cc-caffeine caffeinate

# Your session is now protected!
# Claude can keep working while you sip coffee

# When you're done (or after 15 minutes of auto-cleanup)
echo '{"session_id": "session-abcd"}' | npx cc-caffeine uncaffeinate
```
